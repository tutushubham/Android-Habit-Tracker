## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `python -m graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `python -m graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `python -m graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `python -m graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
- graphify is installed with `pip install graphifyy`. Use `python -m graphify` (the `graphify` script lives in `%APPDATA%\Python\Python313\Scripts`, which is not on PATH on this machine).
